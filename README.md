# DevDecal Final Project
## Multisig Wallet
A multisig wallet is a mechanism that requires more than one key to authorize a transaction.
The purpose of using a multisig wallet is to ensure cooperation is achieved within a group of individuals
and that no one individual or individuals can steal all the tokens within a wallet. Thus, it increases security
as it requires multiple parties to agree before anything is executed.

## Application Example
A 2-of-3 Multisig Wallet: This type of wallet can be used when trying to buy and sell goods. There are three
players within this system: the buyer, the seller, and a third-party member. In the case of this, the buyer
will place the money into the multisig wallet. Once the buyer has received the goods, the buyer will sign the wallet
and the seller will sign the wallet and thus the transaction has completed. If a disagreement occurs, then the
third-party will be the final decider as the wallet has not received a 2-of-3 vote for a side.

## How it is built
A multisig wallet is implemented by advancing the current system of single signature wallets by having multiple
parties be required to provide a signature. The wallet is a decentralized app (Dapp) that is built on the Ethereum
Network using Truffle and Solidity. The main features that must be implemented to achieve the properties of a Multisig wallet are:
  - Deposit function
  - Initializing owner function
  - Adding other owners function
  - Adjustment for required signature function
  - Signing function
  - Confirming and revoking function
  - Executing function
