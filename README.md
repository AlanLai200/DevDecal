## Multisig Wallet
A multisig wallet is a mechanism that requires more than one key to authorize a transaction.
The purpose of using a multisig wallet is to ensure cooperation is achieved within a group of individuals
and that no one individual or individuals can steal all the tokens within a wallet.
